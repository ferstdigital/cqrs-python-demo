# WIP
## cqrs-python-demo
For research purposes only. But feel free to learn from our experiments :)

Generally this is an attempt to do the following:

* working CQRS system
* event sourced
* view model
* commands
* single REST api (for convenience)

**Built with üçÅ by fellows of

## The Stack

Since we're considering event-sourcing and CQRS for our own techstack, I wanted to try it out first hand, using some pre-made event-source offering.
The focus was to get a practical feel of a CQRS implementation, and the possible issues with event-sourcing.

* Event Sourcing [https://geteventstore.com](https://geteventstore.com)
* Event Store Client [https://github.com/madedotcom/atomicpuppy](https://github.com/madedotcom/atomicpuppy)
* REST API [http://flask.pocoo.org](http://flask.pocoo.org)
* View Models [https://www.postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org)

**Other event-sourcing considerations**

* C#, .NET, and plenty of community adapters [https://geteventstore.com](https://geteventstore.com)
* Java [http://eventuate.io](http://eventuate.io)
* Python [https://github.com/johnbywater/eventsourcing](https://github.com/johnbywater/eventsourcing)
* Database Log Tailing [http://debezium.io](http://debezium.io)

## Install

copy `docker.env` to `.env`

Easiest way to get this up and running is to use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

**2. For docker-compose:**
`docker-compose up -d --build`

**2. Locally**

copy `docker.env` to `.env`

**setup python**
`virtualenv env`
`. env/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**start the view model sync**

`python apps/readaccount/app.py`

**start the REST api**

`gunicorn apps.restaccount.app`

## Development
`docker-compose up -d postgres`
`docker-compose up -d eventstore`

see `docker-compose.yml` for exposed ports, passwords, et al.

### What is CQRS?

CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation
